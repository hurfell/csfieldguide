The aim of this exercise is to create a sorted stack of cards. You have to use as less buckets as possible. 
The field "configuration" has to be set bevor you can start. You can choose the number of buckets, you want to use to sort your Stack. After starting the tasks you can not add more buckets.
You just have one mashine. Using the mashine you have to select a digit. The stack will be sorted according to this digtit. You also can choose the buckets, the stack should be placed on. The selected buckets are blue, the others are grey. 
To use the mashine you have to take a stack with drag and drop on the mashine. The mashine takes  the undermost card. The digit in the place selected decides the new stack. If there is a "1" the card is added to the first bucket you select before. The "2" is added to the second bucket and so on. If the bucket is not empty the new card is put on the top of this stack. After the undermost card the next card is put on the new bucket in the same way. The Mashine take all cards from bottom to top. You can guess, you are able to choose all the buckets you want as a target. It is possible to choose buckets, on which is a stack allready. 
You are also allowed to take a stack with drag an drop to another stack. The dragged stack will be merged on top of the other stack.
Now try to use a lot of sorting algorithm to claim your aim. Also you can reduce the number of buckets to get a harder challange.
